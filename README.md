# Social Navigation Task usage notes

## Installation

### Clone repository locally

Download and unzip as a local directory

### Set up a conda environment (recommended)

Creating an enviornment will install all of the necessary python packages into a single environment that can be activated/deactivated as needed
In terminal, navigate to the unzipped directory and run:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml # will create a conda environment called 'social_navigation_analysis'.... may take a minute 
conda activate social_navigation_analysis # activates the environment, so have access to packages etc
```

## Usage

If cloned, add the directory with the cloned repository into the system path, e.g.: 

```python
# add directory into python system path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, /path/to/social_navigation_analysis/social_navigation_analysis')
```

Then, if pip or cloned, import the module 

```python
import social_navigation_analysis as snt
```
